# CrissCross

CrissCross is an app created for large networking events and club fairs. Usually at club fairs many people crowd around a laptop (or worse - a pen) attempting to type in their name and email. 


With CrissCross all that is needed is to scan a QR code and your contact info is instantly swapped. Now you can focus on communicating and not waiting for a line of people to type in their email at a booth.
